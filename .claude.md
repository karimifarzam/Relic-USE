# Project Configuration

## Frontend Development

When building frontend interfaces, components, or pages, use the `/frontend-design` skill to create distinctive, production-grade UI with high design quality. This ensures:

- Creative, polished code that avoids generic AI aesthetics
- Production-ready components
- High visual design quality

## Bug Fixes: Prove It Pattern

When given a bug or error report, the first step is to spawn a subagent to write a test that reproduces the issue. Only proceed once reproduction is confirmed.

**Test level hierarchy** - Reproduce at the lowest level that can capture the bug:
1. Unit test - Pure logic bugs, isolated functions (lives next to the code)
2. Integration test - Component interactions, API boundaries (lives next to the code)
3. UX spec test - Full user flows, browser-dependent behavior (lives in apps/web/specs/)

**For every bug fix:**
1. **Reproduce with subagent** - Spawn a subagent to write a test that demonstrates the bug. The test should fail before the fix.
2. **Fix** - Implement the fix.
3. **Confirm** - The test now passes, proving the fix works.

If the bug is truly environment-specific or transient, document why a test isn't feasible rather than skipping silently.
